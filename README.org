* Description

*isnapshot* creates incremental snapshots while providing the view of full
snapshots.  It uses /rsync/ and the /hardlinks/ mechanism in order to avoid
duplicating data at the snapshot destination.  It provides fast, compact,
incremental and dated snapshots.

*isnapshot* provides a very simple command line script to backup folders. It is
designed to run on lightweight shells such as /ash/ that comes with /BusyBox/ which
runs on several NAS.

*isnapshot* is based on [[https://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/rsync_time_machine.html][Michael Jakl's idea]].
