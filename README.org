* Description

isnapshot creates incremental snapshots while providing the view of full snapshots.
It uses rsync and the hardlinks mechanism in order to avoid duplicating data at
the snapshot destination.  Thanks to isnapshot, you get fast, compact, incremental
and dated snapshots.

isnapshot provides a very simple command line script to backup folders. It is
designed to run on lightweight shells such as 'ash' that comes with BusyBox and
running on several NAS.

isnapshot is based on Michael Jakl's idea (see
https://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/rsync_time_machine.html).
